# Service Providers FSM Export and Import Prerequisites

These prerequisites extend the existing task-CSV export and import checks. They do not
introduce provider creation, alter the ZIP, or require another CMK task to have
completed first. Package shape, provenance, and target binding remain owned
by ora_input_validation.md; upload approval remains with core.data-loader.

## Required Dependency Order

| Sequence | Dependency | What Must Happen |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Exact environment identity | Bind the export source or import destination to the configured Fusion host |
| 2 | Simplified B2B opt-in | Automatically call `verify_cmksp_b2b_document_setup_enabled` through `core.fusion-api.rest-api-client` on that same host and require `EnabledFlag: Y` before export POST or during import preapproval Task Hook validation; do not ask the user for the feature state |
| 3 | Existing input contract | For import, validate the immutable task ZIP and target binding |
| 4 | Dependency decision | Stop on missing, failed, stale, cross-environment, or ambiguous evidence |
| 5 | Existing execution gate | Continue to export-process creation or Data Loader approval only after all prerequisites pass |

## Dependency Rules

| Dependency ID | Dependency | Mandatory | Applies When | Status | Value Source | Resolver | Why | User Guidance | Values to Fill |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| cmksp_b2b_document_setup_enabled | Simplify Configuration and Processing for B2B Messaging (`ORA_CMK_B2B_DOCUMENT_SETUP`) | Yes | Before template export, populated task-data export, and task-CSV import | Verify | Fresh filtered Fusion Features collection read automatically from the operation's exact source or target host through `core.fusion-api.rest-api-client` | verify_cmksp_b2b_document_setup_enabled | Oracle's 26C Collaboration Messaging migration procedure places export and import after this feature is enabled | If disabled, enable the feature through its separate approved opt-in workflow, then retry; do not ask the user to verify state or enable it as part of export or import | Exact FeatureCode and EnabledFlag Y, environment host, read time |

## Dependency Classification

| Result Category | When Used | Can Run Lookup/Create? |
|---|---|---|
| Satisfied | Every applicable check has authoritative evidence, including current same-target opt-in state | No |
| Verify | A complete approved resolver is available and evidence must be retrieved | Read-only lookup only |
| Blocked | The opt-in check fails, or required environment or input evidence is missing, stale, cross-environment, or ambiguous | No |

## Scope Boundaries

The [all-object migration workflow](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/readiness/scm/26c/sccv26c/26C-sccv-wn-f46531.htm)
includes both Service Providers and Simplified Configuration in its project.
That package-scope requirement does not establish a universal prior-task
completion requirement for this standalone task-CSV import. Do not reuse the
legacy trading-partner CSV import's provider/message prerequisites here.

Oracle's 26C procedure supports the opt-in prerequisite for the documented
Collaboration Messaging migration flow. Applying the same gate to the
standalone task-CSV template and data exporter is an FSCR fail-closed policy,
not an Oracle claim that the REST endpoint rejects exports when disabled.

The shared Core REST client performs this read-only check before the task
workflow reaches either shared CLI. The shared export CLI and Data Loader do
not call it automatically, so direct generic CLI use is not a verified Service
Providers workflow.
