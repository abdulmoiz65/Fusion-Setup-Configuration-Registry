## Dependency-Aware Validation

| An Item Validation Organization Name or Item Validation Organization Code is provided | Resolve the Item Validation Organization by the supplied exact OrganizationName or exact OrganizationCode with ClassificationCode INV; use its OrganizationId, MasterOrganizationId, BusinessUnitId, and LegalEntityId for the relationship. | Continue to Legal Entity lookup | resolve_item_validation_organization_exact |
| A Cost Organization or Item Validation Organization LegalEntityId is resolved, or a Legal Entity Name is provided | Resolve the Legal Entity by exact LegalEntityId or exact Name. Confirm the Cost Organization and Item Validation Organization LegalEntityId values match before using the returned Name. | Continue to Inventory Organization lookup or dependency readiness | resolve_legal_entity_exact |
| A Set ID, Set Code, or Set Name is provided | Resolve the Set by the supplied exact SetId, SetCode, or SetName. Populate SetAssignmentId from the returned SetId. | Continue to Inventory Organization lookup or dependency readiness | resolve_set_exact |
| A Cost Book ID or Cost Book Code is provided | Resolve the Cost Book by the supplied exact CostBookId or exact CostBookCode. Populate CostBookIdentifier from CostBookId and PeriodicAverageFlag from PeriodicAverageCostBook. | Continue to Inventory Organization lookup or dependency readiness | resolve_cost_book_exact |
| A Ledger ID or Ledger Name is provided | Resolve the Ledger by the supplied exact LedgerId or exact Name. Populate LedgerIdentifier from LedgerId and use PeriodSetName as the accounting-calendar name. | Continue to Inventory Organization lookup or dependency readiness | resolve_ledger_exact |

Populate CalendarIdentifier from CalendarId. | Continue to Inventory Organization lookup or dependency readiness | resolve_accounting_calendar_exact |
| An Inventory Organization Name or Inventory Organization Code is provided | Resolve the Inventory Organization by the supplied exact OrganizationName or exact OrganizationCode; use OrganizationId for InvOrgId, OrganizationId, and InvOrgParametersOrganizationId; use BusinessUnitId and ProfitCenterBusinessUnitId for the corresponding template fields; compare its LegalEntityId, which is the legal entity associated with the Inventory Organization, with the resolved Cost Organization LegalEntityId; then confirm the item master organization and Cost Organization assignment constraints | Continue to dependency readiness | resolve_inventory_organization_exact |
| A ledger-less Cost Book association is provided | Resolve the existing Cost Books for the Cost Organization and confirm that one is marked as the primary Cost Book | Continue to dependency readiness when a primary Cost Book exists; otherwise report the missing association | resolve_primary_cost_book_by_cost_organization |
| Period-end validation configuration selects Pending Period Close for a periodic average cost enabled Cost Book | Confirm that Pending Period Close is used only for the selected validations that support it | Continue to dependency readiness | |

## Field Validation

| Check | What Happens | Applies When | Resolver |
|---|---|---|---|
| At least one Cost Book is associated to the Cost Organization | Reject the relationship as incomplete | Always | |
| Inventory Organization Effective Start Date defines the first date transactions are costed | Reject a missing effective start date | Creating or updating an inventory organization association | |
| Primary Cost Book is associated to the primary ledger of the Cost Organization legal entity | Resolve existing associations automatically for a ledger-less Cost Book; reject only when no primary Cost Book is found | Creating or updating a ledger-less cost-book association | resolve_primary_cost_book_by_cost_organization |
| Currency and Accounting Calendar are populated when no Ledger is selected | Reject an incomplete ledger-less cost-book association | Creating or updating a ledger-less cost-book association | |
| Cost Book association FromDate is YYYY-MM-DD text | Reject another date representation before preview or submission | Creating or updating a Cost Book association | |
| Cost Book association PATCH uses component identifiers | Reject a nonblank comma-delimited CustomSurrogateId; identify the association with CostOrgId, CostBookId, and CostBookCode | Updating an existing Cost Book association | resolve_cost_book_exact |
| Cost Organization Book Relationships Period End Validations uses PATCH only | Reject a create, POST, delete, or DELETE operation; retain only the existing-record PATCH update | Updating Cost Organization Book Relationships Period End Validations | |
| Period-end validation ValidationType is an authoritative lookup code | Reject a ValidationType that does not resolve exactly through CST_PERIOD_VALIDATION_TYPES; use its returned LookupCode | Updating Cost Organization Book Relationships Period End Validations | resolve_period_validation_type |
| Period-end validation State is an authoritative action code | Reject a State that does not resolve exactly through CST_PERIOD_VALIDATION_ACTIONS; set ValidationActionCode from its LookupCode | Updating Cost Organization Book Relationships Period End Validations | resolve_period_validation_state |
| Requested period-end ValidationType exists for the Cost Organization and Cost Book | Reject a ValidationType not returned by costOrgBookPeriodEndValidations for the resolved CostOrgId and CostBookId | Updating Cost Organization Book Relationships Period End Validations | resolve_existing_period_end_validations |
| Period-end validation PATCH uses the metadata-declared component user key | Reject a populated PeriodEndValSurrogateId, a missing CostOrgId, CostBookId, or ValidationType, or live metadata that does not declare the exact three component UserKeyAttrNames | Updating Cost Organization Book Relationships Period End Validations | resolve_period_end_validation_patch_user_key |
| CostOrgParameterId is blank | Reject a supplied CostOrgParameterId; Fusion generates this primary key when the new Cost Organization Relationship is created | Creating a new Cost Organization Relationship | |
| Period-end validation timing and action are absent | Do not block creation of a Cost Book association; defer the configuration to the Cost Book close process | Creating or updating a Cost Book association without configuring period-end validations | |
