# Manufacturing Work Areas Reference Lookups

All resolvers below are read-only Fusion REST `GET` operations. Invoke them only through `core.fusion-api.rest-api-client` with `REST-Framework-Version: 9`, `onlyData=true`, and the listed `fields`; never use them to create, update, or delete Fusion data.

| Resolver | Runs when | Request | Fields | Match rule | Result / failure rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `verify_inventory_organization` | Every request | `GET /fscmRestApi/resources/11.13.18.05/inventoryOrganizations?q=OrganizationCode='<organization-code>'` | OrganizationId, OrganizationCode, OrganizationName | Exactly one record with the supplied code | Return confirmed organization identity. Zero or multiple results block the workflow. |
| `verify_work_area_absent_for_create` | Before create | `GET /fscmRestApi/resources/11.13.18.05/workAreas?q=OrganizationCode='<organization-code>' and WorkAreaCode='<work-area-code>'`; repeat with `WorkAreaName` | WorkAreaId, OrganizationCode, WorkAreaCode, WorkAreaName, InactiveDate | Both code and name queries return zero records | Continue only when both identities are absent. Any result blocks the create. |
| `resolve_existing_work_area_for_update` | Before update | `GET /fscmRestApi/resources/11.13.18.05/workAreas?q=OrganizationCode='<organization-code>' and WorkAreaName='<work-area-name>'` | WorkAreaId, OrganizationCode, WorkAreaCode, WorkAreaName, WorkAreaDescription, InactiveDate | Exactly one matching active record | Return the existing work-area identity. Zero, multiple, or inactive results block the update. |

The Oracle `workAreas` collection supports filtering by OrganizationCode, WorkAreaCode, WorkAreaName, WorkAreaId, and InactiveDate. Source: https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/supply-chain-and-manufacturing/25c/fasrp/op-workareas-get.html
