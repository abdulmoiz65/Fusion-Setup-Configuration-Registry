# Manage Fiscal Years: Design Enforcement

## Design Principles

Review every provided fiscal-year field against the applicable task export,
table constraints, and documented Fixed Assets guidance. Treat invalid values
as blockers; present valid but suboptimal choices as recommendations and retain
the user's explicit choice.

- Align the Fixed Assets fiscal-year pattern and regular periods with the
  associated GL calendar when asset reporting and close periods must align.
  A different asset calendar requires approved business rationale and a
  documented reconciliation approach.
- Record the fiscal-year pattern, regular-period pattern, and readable period
  suffix. For uneven calendars, such as 4-4-5 or 13-period calendars, validate
  the date coverage and period sequence.

## Coverage and Update Controls

| When | Stop when | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| Update of a used fiscal year | The impact is unknown or target-environment approval is missing | Complete the impact check and obtain explicit approval. |
| First fiscal-year date row for an Oldest-DPIS-based creation | Its inclusive date range does not contain Oldest DPIS (`Start Date <= Oldest DPIS <= End Date`) | Reject it. This is mandatory validation after the reuse-or-create decision and before design preview; compare actual dates, not the fiscal-year label. |
| Fiscal-year coverage | The design does not include the fiscal year that starts in the next calendar year | Extend the planned fiscal years before related calendar work. |
