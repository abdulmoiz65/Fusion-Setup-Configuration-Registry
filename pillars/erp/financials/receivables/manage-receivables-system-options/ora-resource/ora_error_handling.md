# Manage Receivables System Options Error Handling

## Error Situations

| Situation | What Should Happen |
|---|---|
| Required field or conditional set is incomplete | Stop before preview and report the missing business inputs in implementation language; include technical package fields only as supporting diagnostics |
| Source-backed string maximum is exceeded | Stop before candidate ZIP generation. Report the exact entity and field, actual length, allowed maximum, and character unit; ask for a shorter business value and require a new immutable preview. Never silently truncate or rewrite the supplied value |
| Public preflight resolver returns zero or multiple rows | Classify as an invalid dependency for the affected field, record the input and cardinality, and do not choose a candidate or continue that row |
| Confirmed FSM import alternate-key resolver returns null | Record the field-specific dependency token, emit recoverable `AR:::AR_ATTR_NOT_EXISTS_TARGET_INS` with `ATTRIBUTE_NAME_LIST` and alternate-key values, remove the invalid `AR_SYSTEM_OPTIONS` XML element, and stop that row |
| Confirmed accounting-flexfield prompt validation returns no row | Surface `AiAcctFlexKeyLeftPrompt <value> does not exist`, apply the common recoverable invalid-dependency error and XML-element removal behavior, and stop that row |
| Optional public preflight path is unavailable for a Confirmed FSM import-only resolver | Continue static planning without public preflight; do not call internal components directly, and require the field-scoped Data Loader preview resolution or validation |
| Account combination cannot be resolved or validated | Stop the row and report the concatenated segments and ledger/chart-of-accounts context without exposing sensitive physical IDs |
| Existing-row or irreversible rule conflicts | Show the requested-versus-existing difference and require a revised design decision; do not force the change |
| Package/process validation fails | Preserve redacted logs, archive fingerprint, task/process identifiers, and partial results; do not rebuild from current-data values blindly |
| Preview changes after approval | Invalidate approval and produce a new immutable preview |
| Submission result is uncertain | Do not resubmit; reconcile read-only task/process state first |

## Error Classifications

| Result Category | When Used | Next Action |
|---|---|---|
| Input validation | Required group, supported header, flag, or conditional set fails | Correct exact input |
| Dependency not ready | BU, ledger, set, rule, method, source, type, activity, organization, account, or prompt is missing/ambiguous | Correct reference data or input |
| Technical lookup gap | The applicable resolver contract is Partial, To collect, unsupported, or `TBD` | Handle the authoring gap internally. Ask the implementation user only for a bounded business decision or supported value; when eligible, offer the explicit nonproduction runtime-validation override. Never request authoring workbooks, source evidence, or CSV encodings |
| Public preflight limitation | A complete Confirmed FSM import resolution/validation contract exists but no supported public GET exists | Record the limitation and defer only the affected field's check to the immutable Data Loader preview |
| Business decision | Existing setup differs, irreversible behavior applies, or broad side effect requires owner choice | Present a field-level and affected-scope preview |
| Unsupported semantics | Behavioral meaning is not backed by a confirmed source | Ask one bounded business-language clarification or remove the field. A structurally valid value may proceed only with an eligible explicit nonproduction runtime-validation override, immutable preview, and separate approval |
| Package contract gap | Metadata, object identity, headers, release, successful status, or fingerprint is stale/missing | Refresh same-task evidence |
| Auth or authorization | Approved read/export/import privilege unavailable | Refresh approved authentication once for an idempotent read, then stop |
| Transport or environment | Network/service failure occurs before side effect | Retry only bounded idempotent reads |
| Fusion process failed | Export/import child process fails | Preserve redacted status/logs; do not replay automatically |
| Process timeout | Process remains nonterminal beyond bounded wait | Do not resubmit; provide exact next-check path |
| Verification mismatch | Successful process does not reconcile to approved natural-key/field expectations | Show the exact semantic diff and stop |

## Disclosure Rules

| Gate | What Must Be Shown |
|---|---|
| Static readiness | Task code/name, target/release, package identity, resolver classifications, retained public-preflight limitations, open semantic evidence, and no-live-execution status |
| Preview | Business unit, ledger/currency, every changed package field, reference receipts, defaults, irreversible/cross-row effects, unrelated-row preservation, and package fingerprint |
| Approval | Exact immutable preview fingerprint and the literal approval required by the active Data Loader contract |
| Failure | Failure class, target, task/process stage, affected row/field, redacted evidence, partial successes, and recommended action |
| Verification | Terminal process state, exact business-unit natural key, requested-versus-observed field diff, side-effect reconciliation, and zero unrelated mutations |

## Refusal Rules

| Situation | What Must Not Happen |
|---|---|
| No supported public preflight path | Do not invoke internal ADF paths, invent REST URLs, or substitute an unrelated service; use only a complete Confirmed FSM import contract through the separately governed Data Loader path |
| Current-data export is classified | Do not expose or embed environment values in examples, fixtures, documentation, or source control |
| Missing semantic evidence | Do not infer behavior from field names, current values, UI order, or database comments alone. Do not expose or request developer authoring artifacts; ask a bounded business question or use only the documented eligible nonproduction runtime-validation override |
| Developer-only authoring artifacts | Do not ask an implementation user for the Attributes Workbook, Source Register, CodeSearch evidence, source code, or internal CSV encodings |
| Uncertain or changed preview | Do not approve, submit, or retry until a new immutable preview is reviewed |
| Direct resource execution | Do not write Fusion setup from this resource layer; route the package through `core.data-loader` in FSM mode |
| Repository delivery | Do not commit, push, merge, or overwrite another task without separate authorization |

## Task Nodes

| Rule ID | Node Type | Sequence | Action Type | Transitions | Prerequisites | On Failure | Applies When |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RSO.EXECUTION_GATE | decision | 60 | execution_gate | ready->RSO.DONE;blocked->RSO.HANDLE_ERROR | RSO.ENFORCE_DESIGN | stop | Immutable Data Loader preview exists and all static/runtime blockers are resolved |
| RSO.HANDLE_ERROR | step | 70 | error_handler | handled->RSO.RETURN_ISSUES | none | stop | Any validation, lookup, dependency, default, design, preview, or process failure |
| RSO.RETURN_ISSUES | terminal | 80 | terminal | none | none | stop | A blocking issue was classified and disclosed |
| RSO.DONE | terminal | 90 | terminal | none | RSO.EXECUTION_GATE | stop | All resource checks passed and the package is ready for separately approved Data Loader execution |
