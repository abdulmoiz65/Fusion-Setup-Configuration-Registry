# Manage Tax Fields Setup Task Guidance

## Purpose

Provides task-specific setup planning, routing, export, import, and validation guidance for `Manage Tax Fields` under `Expenses`.

## Setup Task Skill Contract

- task_code: `EXM_MANAGE_TAX_FIELDS`
- task_name: `Manage Tax Fields`
- parent_skill_id: `erp.financials.expenses`
- pillar: `ERP`
- offering: `Financials`
- functional_area: `Expenses`
- functional_area_code: `FIN_EXPENSES_DEPLOYED`
- available_flag: `Y`
- export_import_supported_flag: `Y`
- csv_export_import_supported_flag: `Y`
- dataloader_import_mode: `FSM`
- businessObject: ``
- source_catalog: `knowledge/setup-task-catalog/effective/setupTasksAll.json`

## Usage

Use this skill when planning, sequencing, exporting, importing, or validating setup data for `Manage Tax Fields` under `Expenses`.

## Setup Task Metadata

- Task name: `Manage Tax Fields`
- Task code: `EXM_MANAGE_TAX_FIELDS`
- Available: `Y`
- Export/import supported: `Y`
- CSV export/import supported: `Y`
- CSV export/import routing: `supported`
- Data Loader import mode: `FSM`
- Business Object: ``

## CSV Export, Import, and Validation Workflow

`CSVExportImportSupportedFlag` is `Y` for this task, so route task setup data work through the relevant skills:

1. Export setup task data with `shared.setup-export.task-level-export`.
2. Validate setup task data with `shared.validation.setup-data-validator`.
3. Validate reference data with `shared.validation.reference-data-validator`.
4. Import setup task data with `core.data-loader`.

Use this task metadata when invoking those skills:

- Offering: `Financials`
- Functional area / Setup Object: `Expenses`
- Setup task name: `Manage Tax Fields`
- Setup task code: `EXM_MANAGE_TAX_FIELDS`




## Inputs

- `implementation_objective`
- `project_context`
- `setup_task_scope`
- `setup_data_artifacts`

## Outputs

- `setup_task_plan`
- `setup_data_routing`
- `validation_checkpoints`
- `skill_run_record`
- `token_usage_record`

## Implementation Notes

Use the parent functional-area skill `erp.financials.expenses` for functional-area sequencing and scope decisions. Track token usage for any generated project artifact or skill-run record using the manifest policy.

## Evidence-based task workflow

This assisted skill defines explicit-value create/update preparation and a single setup-option CSV policy. Catalog support for FSM import is confirmed. Target preflight, candidate validation and Data Loader approval remain required. Selected scenarios have live evidence; see the dated [coverage summary](references/evidence.md#validation-coverage--2026-10-07). This is not full E2E certification.

For a user-supplied test workbook, read the [setup runbook](references/setup-runbook.md) before preparing a candidate. It defines workbook mappings, missing-input handling, execution prerequisites and evidence needed to close the remaining gaps. It does not waive the executable ora-resource gates.

1. Read [package contract](references/fsm-package-contract.md) and [reviewed evidence](references/evidence.md). Capture project, target environment, intended create/update operation, exact business units, countries or OTHER, desired display switch, and six field behaviors. Do not select a live environment from this skill's evidence.
2. Read the six ora-resource files: [validation](ora-resource/ora_input_validation.md), [lookups](ora-resource/ora_reference_lookups.md), [dependencies](ora-resource/ora_dependency_readiness.md), [defaults](ora-resource/ora_defaulting_rules.md), [design gates](ora-resource/ora_design_enforcement.md), and [errors](ora-resource/ora_error_handling.md).
3. Route a fresh export and reference validation through the dependencies above. Resolve missing or ambiguous target identities. Compare requested changes with current data; preserve unrelated setup options and country rows.
4. Plan the existing compiled task rules using the [Expenses task rule execution guide](../references/task-rule-execution.md) and its local planner; require planned, ready status without an override. Reachable TBD contracts block runtime readiness. Source-backed UI defaults are not CSV import defaults.
5. The active runbook owns payload preparation; core.data-loader owns FSM preview, candidate-specific approval, submission, monitoring and reconciliation. Do not call Fusion REST, a browser writer, SQL, or an import utility directly from this task skill. No approval to author this skill authorizes a Fusion mutation.
6. After an authorized import, verify a fresh task export by business-unit/territory and ENABLE_TAX identities, report partial failures, and register sanitized results and token usage in the selected project. Do not retry failed or timed-out jobs automatically.

## Readiness limitations

BU and territory REST preflight contracts were exercised in the dated test campaign. Resolve them again in each target environment; prior tests do not establish current access or reference validity. Behavior membership is validated by the FSM entity, without requiring a separate public REST equivalent. Candidate audit cells follow the builder's empty-cell convention; all create business fields must be explicit, and update omissions preserve fresh baseline values. Only EXM_SETUP_OPTION.csv carries requested tax-switch rows; EXM_CASH_ADV_SETUP_AND_POLICY.csv remains header-only under DOC-CSV-EMPTY-MEMBER. EXM_VAT_FIELD.csv carries requested tax rules. Compiled rule readiness establishes authoring completeness, not target access or successful import. Fresh-export reconciliation is required after execution. No task-local adapter or live E2E certification is included.


## Repository-only unit tests

Developer tests and synthetic fixtures live under [Expenses test files](../noship/manage-tax-fields/TESTING.md).
Read that guide for the standard-library unittest command and the mapping to
campaign case IDs. These tests cover a local reference harness and mocked core
helpers; they do not certify Fusion setup or authorize execution. Exclude
`expenses/noship/` from deployed skill bundles. It is not part of the runtime workflow.


Automated test cleanup requirements are documented in
[cleanup test guide](../noship/manage-tax-fields/TESTING.md#cleanup-for-automated-test-runs).
Future live test runners must preflight a supported cleanup path, restore
changed setup and verify teardown even after test failures. Unsupported deletion
must block automated create fixtures unless the user explicitly requests
retention for that run. This developer-only policy adds no runtime delete route.
