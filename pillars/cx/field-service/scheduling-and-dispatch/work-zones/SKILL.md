# Work Zones Setup Task Guidance

## Purpose

Provides task-specific setup planning, routing, export, import, and validation guidance for `Work Zones` under `Scheduling and Dispatch`.

## Setup Task Skill Contract

- task_code: `ORA_FFS_TS_WORK_ZONES`
- task_name: `Work Zones`
- parent_skill_id: `cx.field-service.scheduling-and-dispatch`
- pillar: `CX`
- offering: `Field Service`
- functional_area: `Scheduling and Dispatch`
- functional_area_code: `ORA_FFS_FA_SCHEDULING_AND_DISPATCH`
- available_flag: `Y`
- export_import_supported_flag: `UNKNOWN`
- csv_export_import_supported_flag: `UNKNOWN`
- source_catalog: `knowledge/setup-task-catalog/effective/setupTasksAll.json`

## Usage

Use this skill when planning, sequencing, exporting, importing, or validating setup data for `Work Zones` under `Scheduling and Dispatch`.

## Setup Task Metadata

- Task name: `Work Zones`
- Task code: `ORA_FFS_TS_WORK_ZONES`
- Available: `Y`
- Export/import supported: `UNKNOWN`
- CSV export/import supported: `UNKNOWN`
- CSV export/import routing: `not supported`

## Execution Directions

- Default: `ora_rest_execution`. Use only the documented Work Zones REST contract through `scripts/run_work_zone.py`.
- Data Loader is not an execution direction for this task. CSV package import remains unsupported by the effective catalog.
- Do not fall back automatically between directions. Data Loader and other endpoint families are unsupported.

## CSV Export, Import, and Validation Workflow

`CSVExportImportSupportedFlag` is `UNKNOWN`, so this task is not marked as CSV export/import supported in the effective setup-task catalog.

Do not route CSV export work to `shared.setup-export.task-level-export` or CSV import work to `core.data-loader` unless live Fusion metadata or Oracle guidance confirms support. Use `shared.validation.setup-data-validator` only when a setup data artifact is available for review. Use `shared.validation.reference-data-validator` when the task depends on cross-pillar reference data.


## Shared Field Service Orchestration

Start from `pillars/cx/field-service/SKILL.md`. The reusable lifecycle—route selection, current-state reads, immutable preview/checksum, approval binding, ordered write, redacted evidence, and GET verification—is owned only by `pillars/cx/field-service/scripts/task_orchestration.py`.

`scripts/task_adapter.py` owns Work Zones workbook mapping, Work Zone validation, OFSC Metadata paths, request payloads, and verification rules. `scripts/run_work_zone.py` is the only task entry point. Do not invoke the adapter or Core REST client directly.



## Inputs

- `implementation_objective`
- `project_context`
- `setup_task_scope`
- `work_zones_workbook`: a readable `.xlsx` workbook containing the `Work Zones` worksheet and the required yellow design-evidence columns
- `assets/Work_Zones_Input_Template.xlsx`: task-local end-user input template; blue columns map to the REST request and yellow columns are design evidence only
- `execution_direction`: omit or specify `ora_rest_execution` for the documented Work Zones create-or-replace route
- `project_id`: an existing durable FSCR project workspace; required by `scripts/run_work_zone.py`
- `setup_data_artifacts`

## Execution Safety

### Preflight

Before a preview or write, the runner validates the selected environment identity, the Work Zones workbook, required API fields, active/inactive status, unique case-insensitive keys, and the 50-character key limit. It then executes `WZ.ENFORCE_DESIGN` against the required yellow design-evidence columns before any current-state GET. This is an evidence-completeness gate: it does not falsely claim to prove live geography, assignment, or routing outcomes. `travelArea` is deprecated by OFSC and omitted from the workbook mapping and REST payload. The runner obtains a current-state GET baseline for every label; HTTP 404 selects collection POST creation, while an existing baseline selects singular PUT replacement. It then creates an immutable, redacted preview bound to the target environment and checksum.

### Failure and Retry Behavior

Classify malformed workbook data as input validation, incomplete design evidence as a design-enforcement blocker, unsupported direction or contract gaps as catalog or metadata mismatch, request failures as Fusion API or transport failures, and unmatched approval as an approval blocker. Do not retry a live POST or PUT automatically. Stop on the first write or verification failure, retain only redacted evidence and an append-only run record under the selected project workspace, including only an allowlisted HTTP status, Fusion error code, or field when available, and require a fresh preview and explicit approval before another attempt. See `ora-resource/ora_error_handling.md` for the task-local disclosure and refusal rules.

## Outputs

- `setup_task_plan`
- `setup_data_routing`
- `validation_checkpoints`
- `skill_run_record`
- `token_usage_record`

## Implementation Notes

Use the parent functional-area skill `cx.field-service.scheduling-and-dispatch` for functional-area sequencing and scope decisions. Track token usage for any generated project artifact or skill-run record using the manifest policy.
