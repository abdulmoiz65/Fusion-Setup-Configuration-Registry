# Shifts and Schedules Setup Task Guidance

## Purpose

Provides task-specific setup planning, routing, export, import, and validation guidance for `Shifts and Schedules` under `Scheduling and Dispatch`.

## Setup Task Skill Contract

- task_code: `ORA_FFS_TS_SHIFTS_AND_SCHEDULES`
- task_name: `Shifts and Schedules`
- parent_skill_id: `cx.field-service.scheduling-and-dispatch`
- pillar: `CX`
- offering: `Field Service`
- functional_area: `Scheduling and Dispatch`
- functional_area_code: `ORA_FFS_FA_SCHEDULING_AND_DISPATCH`
- available_flag: `Y`
- export_import_supported_flag: `UNKNOWN`
- csv_export_import_supported_flag: `UNKNOWN`
- source_catalog: `knowledge/setup-task-catalog/effective/setupTasksAll.json`

## Usage

Use this skill when planning, validating, previewing, or importing `Shifts and Schedules` setup data from a workbook template completed by the end user.

## Filled Workbook Template Intake

The end user supplies one filled XLSX configuration workbook. The `Work Schedules` worksheet is authoritative for this task; the workbook filename is not.

The worksheet contains the `Work Schedules` table and the `Shifts` table. Preserve each workbook value exactly until validation. Do not infer a REST payload from a display name, a workbook row number, or an empty cell.

| Workbook section | Required end-user fields | REST use | Refusal condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Work Schedules | Name, Label, Active | Creates or resolves the parent work schedule by label before any item request | The label, name, or active state is missing |
| Shifts | Work Schedule Label, Name, Label, Active, Type, Start time, End time, Points, Decoration | Creates or resolves the parent shift by label before any schedule-item request | The shift label, referenced schedule, or required shift fields are missing |
| Work-schedule item payload | `work_schedule_label`, `itemId`, `type`, `shiftLabel` or `nonWorkingReasonLabel`, `startDate`, `endDate` when applicable, and repeat fields | Maps the completed workbook row to the documented OFSC item body only after its schedule and shift are planned | Required workbook fields are absent |

The current `Work Schedules` worksheet does not by itself provide every Shift Item payload field. The end user must provide the missing payload fields in the filled template or as a clearly associated workbook table. Do not fabricate `record_type`, dates, recurrence, `shift_id`, `non_working_reason_id`, or internal IDs.

## Preflight Checks

Before any current-state lookup, preview, or write, the runner validates the filled workbook, required REST fields, task design rules, execution direction, and target configuration. It uses each parent-label GET as the current-state baseline; a missing parent is created from the corresponding `Work Schedules` or `Shifts` workbook row through a conditional PUT. It then verifies the requested operation is preview or has an immutable-preview checksum with explicit approval for the target environment. A failed preflight stops the route before any REST call; it does not fall back to Data Loader, PATCH, or inferred payload values.

## REST Parent and Item Contract

Source: [API Structure - Configuration](https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/display/OFSCdev/API+Structure+-+Configuration), Work Schedules and Shifts v1 sections. The REST client uses the documented Configuration API paths below.

Use the documented metadata API in this mandatory dependency order:

| Operation | Method and path | Identity | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create or resolve work schedule | PUT `/api/field-service/configuration/v1/workSchedules/{label}` | Work schedule label | Parent schedule read-back |
| Create or resolve shift | PUT `/api/field-service/configuration/v1/shifts/{label}` | Shift label | Parent shift read-back |
| Read items | GET `/api/field-service/configuration/v1/workSchedules/{label}/items` | Work schedule label | Work-schedule item collection |
| Create item | POST `/api/field-service/configuration/v1/workSchedules/{label}/items` | Work schedule label plus validated payload | Created item |
| Update item | PUT `/api/field-service/configuration/v1/workSchedules/{label}/items/{itemId}` | Work schedule label and positive workbook `itemId` | Updated item |
| Delete item | DELETE `/api/field-service/configuration/v1/workSchedules/{label}/items/{itemId}` | Work schedule label and positive workbook `itemId` | No content |

For a `shift` POST, map the completed workbook row to the OFSC item body using this shape. `shiftLabel`, `repeatType`, and `repeatDays` are workbook fields; they are not emitted unchanged:

```json
{
  "type": "shift",
  "label": "SH_EAST_DAY",
  "shiftType": "regular",
  "startDate": "2024-06-17",
  "endDate": "2024-12-31",
  "recurrence": {
    "type": "weekly",
    "every": 1,
    "startDate": "2024-06-17",
    "endDate": "2024-12-31",
    "weekdays": ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday"]
  }
}
```

The work schedule and shift PUTs are documented upserts. A new parent uses `If-None-Match: {label}`; an existing parent is read before preview and then explicitly represented in the immutable plan. An on-call shift requires `decoration` with one of `yellow`, `orange`, `red`, `blue`, `green`, or `purple`; decoration is not allowed for a regular shift. A workbook `shiftLabel` maps to OFSC item `label`, with its configured `shiftType`; a workbook `nonWorkingReasonLabel` maps to OFSC item `label`. If `endDate` is supplied, it must not precede `startDate`; weekly workbook repeats require `repeatDays`, which map to full weekday names in `recurrence.weekdays`.

This contract creates or resolves documented parent resources before it handles individual work-schedule items. It does not authorize an undocumented bulk import endpoint or a live mutation. Before a live POST, PUT, or DELETE, create an immutable preview from the exact filled workbook rows and obtain explicit approval for the target environment, operation, path, payload, and identity.

## Execution Direction

The filled workbook is validated before any route is selected. `execution_direction` is optional; when it is omitted, use the Data Loader-based direction. It is a route preference, not authorization to bypass source, preview, approval, or verification gates.

| execution_direction | Selection | Owner | Route behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data_loader_execution` | Default | `core.data-loader` | Validate the workbook and use the Core Data Loader workflow only if its applicable source, metadata, immutable-preview, and approval gates confirm a supported import contract. `CSVExportImportSupportedFlag=UNKNOWN` is a hard stop for an assumed FSM CSV import. |
| `ora_rest_execution` | Explicit user selection | This pillar task plus `core.fusion-api.rest-api-client` | Resolve/create work schedules, resolve/create shifts, then read and mutate work-schedule items. Bind the full ordered plan to the immutable preview and approval, execute once, then verify with GET. |

The Core `task-rest` executor currently accepts only GET, POST, and PATCH. It cannot execute the documented Shift Item PUT contract. Do not substitute PATCH. For a requested PUT, the selected `ora_rest_execution` route uses the shared `core.fusion-api.rest-api-client` after all task gates pass; it remains subject to explicit approval and read-back verification. DELETE is never selected from a filled workbook unless the user explicitly requests deletion and approves the exact positive `internalId`.

## Executable REST Route

The `ora_rest_execution` contract is implemented rather than merely described:

```text
pillars/cx/field-service/scripts/task_orchestration.py
pillars/cx/field-service/scheduling-and-dispatch/shifts-and-schedules/scripts/task_adapter.py
pillars/cx/field-service/scheduling-and-dispatch/shifts-and-schedules/scripts/run_shifts_and_schedules.py
```

The runner accepts the filled workbook, produces an immutable JSON preview, and stops at approval by default. It delegates all HTTP calls to `core/fusion-api/rest-api-client`; task-specific workbook mapping, API paths, payload validation, deletion acknowledgement, and GET verification remain in the Shifts adapter.

```bash
python3 pillars/cx/field-service/scheduling-and-dispatch/shifts-and-schedules/scripts/run_shifts_and_schedules.py \
  --workbook <filled-workbook.xlsx> \
  --execution-direction ora_rest_execution \
  --mode preview \
  --output <preview.json>
```

## Failure Handling and Safety

- Validate the filled workbook and every required REST field before current-state lookup, preview, or write.
- Classify failures as input validation, approval blocker, auth/authz, transport/environment, Fusion API, verification mismatch, or artifact persistence. Return the stage and redacted evidence.
- A cached-token refresh may occur once inside the shared client for a rejected read. Do not retry POST, PUT, DELETE, import, or an uncertain write outcome.
- The immutable preview checksum binds the target environment, GET baselines, paths, methods, and request bodies. Any change requires a fresh preview and approval.
- Stop after the first write failure or failed GET verification. Do not substitute PATCH, roll back, or fall back to Data Loader.
- DELETE needs both approval of the exact checksum and the explicit runner `--allow-delete` acknowledgement.

## Setup Task Metadata

- Task name: `Shifts and Schedules`
- Task code: `ORA_FFS_TS_SHIFTS_AND_SCHEDULES`
- Available: `Y`
- Export/import supported: `UNKNOWN`
- CSV export/import supported: `UNKNOWN`
- CSV export/import routing: `not supported`

## CSV Export, Import, and Validation Workflow

`CSVExportImportSupportedFlag` is `UNKNOWN`, so this task is not marked as CSV export/import supported in the effective setup-task catalog.

Do not route CSV export or CSV import work to `shared.setup-export.task-level-export` or `shared.setup-import.task-level-import` unless live Fusion metadata or Oracle guidance confirms support. Use `shared.validation.setup-data-validator` only when a setup data artifact is available for review. Use `shared.validation.reference-data-validator` when the task depends on cross-pillar reference data.


## Inputs

- `implementation_objective`
- `project_context`
- `setup_task_scope`
- `filled_workbook_template`
- `execution_direction` — optional; defaults to `data_loader_execution`; accepted alternate is `ora_rest_execution`

## Outputs

- `setup_task_plan`
- `setup_data_routing`
- `validation_checkpoints`
- `skill_run_record`
- `token_usage_record`
- `execution_route`

## Implementation Notes

Use the parent functional-area skill `cx.field-service.scheduling-and-dispatch` for functional-area sequencing and scope decisions. Track token usage for any generated project artifact or skill-run record using the manifest policy.
