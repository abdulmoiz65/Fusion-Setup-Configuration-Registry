# Resource Types Setup Task Guidance

## Purpose

Provides task-specific setup planning, routing, export, import, and validation guidance for `Resource Types` under `Scheduling and Dispatch`.

## Setup Task Skill Contract

- task_code: `ORA_FFS_TS_RESOURCE_TYPES`
- task_name: `Resource Types`
- parent_skill_id: `cx.field-service.scheduling-and-dispatch`
- pillar: `CX`
- offering: `Field Service`
- functional_area: `Scheduling and Dispatch`
- functional_area_code: `ORA_FFS_FA_SCHEDULING_AND_DISPATCH`
- available_flag: `Y`
- export_import_supported_flag: `UNKNOWN`
- csv_export_import_supported_flag: `UNKNOWN`
- source_catalog: `knowledge/setup-task-catalog/effective/setupTasksAll.json`

## Usage

Use this skill when planning, sequencing, exporting, importing, or validating setup data for `Resource Types` under `Scheduling and Dispatch`.

## Setup Task Metadata

- Task name: `Resource Types`
- Task code: `ORA_FFS_TS_RESOURCE_TYPES`
- Available: `Y`
- Export/import supported: `UNKNOWN`
- CSV export/import supported: `UNKNOWN`
- CSV export/import routing: `not supported`

## CSV Export, Import, and Validation Workflow

`CSVExportImportSupportedFlag` is `UNKNOWN`, so this task is not marked as CSV export/import supported in the effective setup-task catalog.

Do not route CSV export work to `shared.setup-export.task-level-export` or CSV import work to `core.data-loader` unless live Fusion metadata or Oracle guidance confirms support. Use `shared.validation.setup-data-validator` only when a setup data artifact is available for review. Use `shared.validation.reference-data-validator` when the task depends on cross-pillar reference data.

## Workbook Intake

Use the `Resource Types` worksheet in the supplied configuration workbook as the task input. The workbook filename is not authoritative because it also contains unrelated worksheets, including `Time Slots` and `Work Skills`.

The customer-ready [Resource Types input template](assets/Resource_Types_Input_Template.xlsx) provides the accepted row layout and its companion `Resource Type Details` worksheet. It remains a free-format intake: equivalent customer workbooks are accepted when they supply the same information.

The intake must retain the worksheet's Resource Type labels, active flags, associated resource roles, feature flags, load thresholds, cost-of-time settings, travel settings, and statistic parameters. Before a preview, reject a workbook that has no `Resource Types` worksheet, duplicate Resource Type labels, an empty label, or contradictory mutually exclusive selections for the same Resource Type.

The workbook-derived records are a design input; they are not a REST payload and must not be sent unchanged to Fusion.

## Shared Field Service Task Orchestration

Start at the Field Service offering skill, then invoke only
`scripts/run_resource_types.py` for this task. The shared
`pillars/cx/field-service/scripts/task_orchestration.py` owns route selection,
immutable preview creation, checksum-bound approval, ordered writes, and GET
verification. `scripts/task_adapter.py` owns only Resource Types workbook
mapping, capability defaulting, metadata lookups, and business-field checks.

The default execution direction is `core.data-loader.task-rest`. It must not
fall back to `ora_rest_execution`. If the Core Task REST route does not permit
the declared `PUT`, block and request explicit `ora_rest_execution`.

For the explicit live-write route, use the complete contract in
[`ora-resource/ora_rest_execution.md`](ora-resource/ora_rest_execution.md):
free-format workbook validation, active English preflight, false-by-default
optional capabilities, OFSC Metadata GET baselines, immutable SHA-256 preview,
explicit checksum approval, ordered no-retry PUTs, and GET verification.

Persist only redacted diagnostic and run evidence under `project/{project_id}`.
Do not persist credentials, OAuth tokens, or customer payloads.

## Failure Handling and Recovery

Load [`ora-resource/ora_error_handling.md`](ora-resource/ora_error_handling.md)
before preview or live execution. The runner executes the compiled nested
`RT.*` validation and design-enforcement graph before REST preflight; any
applicable Error rule blocks preview and PUT. Classify failures as
`input_validation`, `design_enforcement`, `authorization_or_privilege`,
`fusion_api`, `artifact_persistence`, `approval_blocker`, or
`partial_execution`.

Retry only a cached-token `401` or `403` through the Core client once. Never
retry a PUT automatically. A PUT or read-back failure stops the displayed
sequence, sends no later PUT, and requires a fresh continuation preview after
read-back reconciliation. Persist redacted project evidence with status,
stage, failure class, safe message, recommended action, environment, checksum,
checks run, and a partial-failure errors array. It must never contain labels,
payloads, baselines, credentials, or tokens.


## Inputs

- `implementation_objective`
- `project_context`
- `setup_task_scope`
- `setup_data_artifacts`

## Outputs

- `setup_task_plan`
- `setup_data_routing`
- `validation_checkpoints`
- `skill_run_record`
- `token_usage_record`

## Implementation Notes

Use the parent functional-area skill `cx.field-service.scheduling-and-dispatch` for functional-area sequencing and scope decisions. Track token usage for any generated project artifact or skill-run record using the manifest policy.
