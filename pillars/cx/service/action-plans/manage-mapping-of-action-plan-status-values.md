# Manage Mapping of Action Plan Status Values

## Setup Task Metadata

- Task name: `Manage Mapping of Action Plan Status Values`
- Task code: `ORA_SVC_MANAGE_ACTION_PLAN_ACTION_STATUS_MAPPING`
- Available: `Y`
- Export/import supported: `Y`
- CSV export/import supported: `Y`
- CSV export/import routing: `supported`
- Data Loader import mode: `FSM`
- Business Object: ``






## FSM Data Loader Package Requirements

1. Read the task's fsm_contract first when it is present. Treat its objects and field guidance as the task-specific starting point for classifying each requested change as an existing-root update, new root, existing-child update, new child of an existing parent, new relationship, or mixed package change.
2. Read `ASM_SETUP_CSV_METADATA.xml` in the task export package for business objects, XML paths, node sequence, attributes, scope, and relationships; reconcile it with the task's fsm_contract when one is present.
3. Use the fsm_contract object and field guidance together with metadata-defined node sequence and relationships to determine package order and required object coverage.
4. Verify the selected baseline or template package includes the members, file names, structure, headers, encoding, scope, relationship rows, and fsm_contract objects and fields required for the requested change.
5. Treat a completed export of this same setup task as authoritative evidence for package structure, headers, node order, key and linkage shape, and generated-identity handling. Use it to corroborate the fsm_contract and record provenance for copied template values.
6. For existing-row updates, retain exported identities and all unchanged values, parent rows, child rows, and relationships required by the fsm_contract and package evidence; do not carry unrelated baseline rows into the change package unless they are required for import integrity. Change only approved fields.
7. For a new child or relationship, retain the existing parent identity and use only linkage, keys, and required values specified by the fsm_contract or confirmed by same-task package evidence.
8. For greenfield rows, construct the create contract from the fsm_contract, task-specific documented requirements, `ASM_SETUP_CSV_METADATA.xml`, a completed export of this same task, and supported preview or dry-run results where available.
9. An export whose data CSV members contain only headers is valid structural evidence for a greenfield contract, not an automatic blocker. Use the fsm_contract, exported package structure, and explicit supported inputs to construct the rows; stop only when required fields, keys, relationships, or values remain unresolved or validation rejects the package.
10. Populate every root, child, scoped, localized, and relationship object required by the fsm_contract or confirmed package contract. Populate approved business keys, required values, and reference values; omit generated identities unless explicitly required.
11. Classify every populated fsm_contract field as request-provided, documented requirement, export-derived structural value, export-derived template value, generated or omittable, or unresolved.
12. A fsm_contract field may be omitted only when it is documented as generated or optional, is absent or consistently blank in semantically comparable exports of this same task, or is accepted as omitted by supported preview or dry-run validation. Do not infer a value solely from a field name or description.
13. Do not copy identities, reference keys, parent keys, scope values, localized values, lookup codes, or behavior-changing settings unless the fsm_contract, request, documented guidance, or approved compatible template default explicitly supports the value.
14. Verify every non-generated parent, lookup, code, scope, locale, and related-object reference required by the fsm_contract against approved same-task package evidence or the workflow's documented resolver; include required parents or relationship rows only when the package contract requires them.
15. Build the complete package required by the fsm_contract and package evidence; never use a child-only package or infer fields, defaults, identities, or relationships from another task or object type.
16. Validate package members, fsm_contract objects and fields, metadata, keys, scopes, references, relationships, node order, field-value provenance, and approved changes before import; confirm that no baseline identity, template-only setting, or unrelated row is introduced or modified unintentionally. Use preview or dry-run validation when available.
17. Stop when a required fsm_contract field or object, identity rule, parent-child linkage, scope, dependency, or behavior-changing setting remains unresolved and lacks an explicit approved value or sufficient same-task evidence. Do not block for fields evidenced as generated or validated-omittable.
## Use Cases

### Review Action Plan Status Mappings

Review Action Plan status-condition mappings for a selected action type before creating or changing a condition.

1. Export Action Plan status mappings with shared.setup-export.task-level-export.
2. Review each mapping's action type, action-plan status, attribute, operator, value, and condition expression.

### Create Action Plan Status Mapping

Create a status-condition mapping for a selected action type and action-plan status.

1. Export Action Plan status mappings with shared.setup-export.task-level-export.
2. Select the action type, action-plan status, attribute, operator, and value from the supported choices for that action type.
3. Use the selected action type's exported object fields and condition shape; do not reuse a Case StatusCd condition for an Appointment, which uses ObjectEntityName=Activity.
4. Add only the approved condition row to ORA_SVC_AP_STATUS_CONDITION.csv and retain the exported task-package structure.
5. Validate the FSM package with shared.validation.setup-data-validator.
6. Import the approved ZIP with core.data-loader and wait for terminal processing status.
7. Verify the created mapping with a fresh export.

### Update Action Plan Status Mapping

Update an existing status-condition mapping without changing its selected action type unintentionally.

1. Export Action Plan status mappings with shared.setup-export.task-level-export.
2. Identify the exact mapping from the fresh export and update only approved action-plan status, attribute, operator, value, or condition fields that are supported by its action type.
3. Retain the action type's exported object fields and condition shape; do not reuse fields or conditions from a different action type.
4. Validate the FSM package with shared.validation.setup-data-validator.
5. Import the approved ZIP with core.data-loader and wait for terminal processing status.
6. Verify the updated mapping with a fresh export.
## Purpose

Map status values of related objects, such as service requests, tasks, and activities, to action plan status values.
## FSM Contract

### ORA_SVC_AP_STATUS_CONDITION

- `ChildObjectName`: Populate only the selected action type's exported child object name.
- `ObjectEntityName`: Populate only the selected action type's exported object entity name.
- `ActionStatusCd`: Populate only the approved Action Plan status code for the selected action type.
- `CompletionFlag`: Populate only the approved completion behavior.
- `Condition`: Populate only the approved condition expression using the selected action type's exported shape.
- `DeletedFlag`: Retain the exported value unless an approved supported lifecycle change requires it.
- `Description`: Populate only the approved description.
- `Name`: Populate only the approved mapping name.
## Guard Rails

1. Require an authenticated Fusion user context before any Fusion operation; use `core.auth.fusion-oauth-authentication`.
2. Do not use `core.fusion-api.rest-api-client` to create, update, or delete records.
3. Do not use `shared.setup-import.task-level-import` to create, update, or delete records.
## CSV Export, Import, and Validation Workflow

`CSVExportImportSupportedFlag` is `Y` for this task, so route task setup data work through the relevant skills:

1. Export task setup data with `shared.setup-export.task-level-export`.
2. Validate exported or prepared task setup data with `shared.validation.setup-data-validator`.
3. Import setup task data with `core.data-loader`.

Use this task metadata when invoking those skills:

- Offering: `Service`
- Functional area / Setup Object: `Action Plans`
- Setup task name: `Manage Mapping of Action Plan Status Values`
- Setup task code: `ORA_SVC_MANAGE_ACTION_PLAN_ACTION_STATUS_MAPPING`




## Usage

Use this metadata file when planning, sequencing, exporting, importing, or validating setup data for `Manage Mapping of Action Plan Status Values` under `Action Plans`.
